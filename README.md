# Nutrition facts
In this webapp you can search for the ingredients of whole foods.  
The purpose of this project was to create my first application that consumes an API.  
I used the spoonacular API to have access to a large database: https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs.

## Technologies
* Python 3.7
* Django 3.1
* Bootstrap 5

## Features
* On the homepage the users can search for the food by giving the name, the amount and the unit. There is a built-in autocomplete function for the convenient search.
* The search results show the weight, the caloric breakdown and a detailed table about the nutrients.
